                <h1>Weather Site Plan</h1>
                <p>The purpose of The Weather Site is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways.<br>  The initial page will give the weather for the current location based on the Geocoding <br>location information from the device.  The second is weather for 3 specific locations<br> accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location determined <br>by a search string.</p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be <br>split between mobile devices and laptops. A secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather.</p>
        <h2>Audience Goals</h2>
        <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather <br>conditions for their current location as they head off to class or study. They are also often <br>far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for a specific location<br> is important as well.  The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to get<br> weather conditions for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips.</p>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <img src="/weather/plan-images/cool-joe.jpg" alt="Cool Joe image">
        <ul>
            <li>Name: Joe Cool</li>
            <li>Occupation: student</li>
            <li>Age: Eternally 18</li>
            <li>Interests: Traveling, Flying, Play acting, Eating</li>
            <li>Motivation: Joe is not into planning.  His last minute scrambling, whether it is<br> getting to class in the morning or heading out on his latest adventure, has left him <br>unprepared for weather conditions many times (He is tired of sleeping in the rain and snow). <br>He would like to be more prepared...without having to put much effort into it...or planning.</li>
            <li>Environment:  Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices, he will most<br> often be found on a smart phone however.  Many of the places he frequents do not <br>have great signalâ€¦he is often dealing with 3G speeds</li>
